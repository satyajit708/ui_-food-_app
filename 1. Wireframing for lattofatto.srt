1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,040
Welcome back in this world, we're going to make wireframe for our project that is that offered online

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,030
full order application, so you can see the application is look like this.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,470
This is the final project.

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,450
So let's create a wire frame for it.

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:13,980
Let's create a new page.

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,930
Click on the plus icon.

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:17,970
So these are applied.

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,980
So let's rename it.

9
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:29,310
So first of all, we are going to need frame, you can press F or you can go into this section and choose

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,800
frame and select iPhone 11 Pro Max frame.

11
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:38,200
So in first frame, we only want to show the brand name that is left of it.

12
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,750
So let's clear some components for it.

13
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,360
First, let's make some more frames.

14
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,010
OK, our five frames are created now.

15
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:57,010
So first frame is going to be our brand name page, and the second one is signing face, then third

16
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,500
one in sign up page and in fourth frame.

17
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:07,210
We are going to add like a fourth we can order food is there like burger pizza and fried chicken and

18
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:07,600
all that.

19
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,660
So I think we don't need a fifth trip.

20
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:11,950
So let's do this one.

21
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,190
If the frame rate on your keyboard.

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,760
The frame is different now.

23
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,370
So we have all frames now.

24
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:32,250
Let's make some components select the rectangle, draw the angle, like this ad or text?

25
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,560
So it is going to be our brand name.

26
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,210
The font is too small.

27
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:43,640
Select the font, go to design panel and increase the font of two local politics.

28
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,170
OK.

29
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,140
I just want.

30
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,130
And the center.

31
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,930
So this is our first component.

32
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:58,610
So select the both the rectangle and the text to select the multiple things you know that we have to

33
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:08,030
hold, shift and press the text and the rectangle are selected now and we have to press control G to

34
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,170
make a group.

35
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:17,010
So if I move like this, then bolting together, let's say you don't make a group on this.

36
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,750
First of all, I neutral on this.

37
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,990
OK, so if I move this?

38
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,100
You can see the brand name is not coming with this tangle.

39
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,210
That's why we grouped them.

40
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:33,720
So for grouping Celebrity Angle, you hold shift celebrity and press control.

41
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:42,840
And this is now a group, so if I like a more like this on the screen, you can see the mood things

42
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,480
are going to get less May goes down.

43
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:53,220
So I told you how to make component, select your element and go to Bomberman and select this one button.

44
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:01,470
And now this is your component, so you can use them multiple times in your project, and you can also

45
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:05,370
access to this asset when you can see the brand name.

46
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,790
Let's make a second component that is going to be our image.

47
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,140
Let's choose rectangle.

48
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,580
The shortcut is are.

49
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,480
And let's make a perfect square hole shift.

50
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,920
Like this, and let's earn some.

51
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:21,820
What do you want him?

52
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:30,460
You can see the color of Polygon and the square is gray, so we have to change the color of Polygon,

53
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:38,920
so to do that, select the Polygon Go and redesign panel, click on the field and let's move this closer

54
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,560
to us.

55
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,020
White like this?

56
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,300
This smallest one like this.

57
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,140
OK, let's duplicate this one.

58
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,300
OK.

59
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:55,490
Michael, from this side of the mountain, and let's make a small.

60
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:57,840
Some.

61
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,470
Okay.

62
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:07,560
Like this, we have to also change the color of their skin onto whites like this.

63
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:09,970
OK.

64
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:16,620
So this is our image and select all the things and press control.

65
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,140
So this thing is group now and let's make this.

66
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,460
Element into component.

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,060
So this is our second component.

68
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,640
So let's make a profile picture.

69
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,380
Component four.

70
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:38,580
We are going to use Circle so we can price or we can use this ellipsis button.

71
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,220
Moist air from this imagine.

72
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,690
First of all, we need to.

73
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,010
Make it small.

74
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:53,970
Now let's add this image into this segment, or we can see the image is not visible because it is in

75
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,320
the images selected.

76
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:00,480
Click right on it and you can see the option been to front.

77
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:11,020
And you can see the images now in front like this and select all of the things from press control gene

78
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,170
to group them is now grouped and let's make a component.

79
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,250
OK, this one is a component now.

80
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,490
So this element is for profile picture.

81
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,750
Let's make sign in and sign up Bar Navigation Bar.

82
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,140
For that, we are on a new rectangle.

83
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:33,690
Let's make sure it's not just with our frame, so it perfectly matches with our screen.

84
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,780
I think we have to dig a little bit.

85
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,090
Now, let's add a text image.

86
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,350
First on its signing.

87
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,070
And the second one is sign up.

88
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:55,310
So let's align them together, set all the things for us to take the sign in the rectangle.

89
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,350
Now select the sign up button.

90
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:04,340
Now go to design Bennett and let's first and then bottom novelists align them vertically.

91
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,320
OK, it is now.

92
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:14,930
So next thing we have to make is that logging button and a button, so that sort of distress lubricated

93
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,250
by pressing art.

94
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,580
And the first one is going to be our logging.

95
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,830
I forgot to make this navigation bar into component.

96
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,340
Select all the things control G and select only just one button.

97
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:37,260
So this thing is not component, let's make this page also a component.

98
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,780
Duplicate this burden and remember to.

99
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,290
Sign up.

100
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:53,610
So this is our last component, and we are going to need some major buttons like hamburger or some icons

101
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,530
like Facebook, Google and Twitter.

102
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,380
Intimate library really, really showed you.

103
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,640
We installed some icon packages so we can use this.

104
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,290
Use them in this project.

105
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,420
So to access those things, go to Assad and click on this book icon.

106
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,420
You can see for the Icon Plus actor.

107
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,220
Click on this toggle button.

108
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:20,270
You can see we can use this icons, so we need this hamburger menu icon.

109
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,720
So let's more.

110
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,390
This one, and you can also search.

111
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,350
Like Facebook, Twitter.

112
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,890
And so long as we were.

113
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,490
But it is not available so we can use.

114
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,570
Other icons, like all of this is.

115
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,570
OK, we now have these four icons.

116
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,670
Let's make our wireframe.

117
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,560
So we created all the components, so we are going to use them in our bathroom.

118
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:57,240
So in front page, we have to add a brand name.

119
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,080
So I'm going to.

120
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:07,300
Drank this like this, let it just it vertically okayed it, and just now, let's rename it into like

121
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:07,840
brand.

122
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,700
And second, he's is going to be signing.

123
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,770
And the third one is a line of which.

124
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,090
And the last one is men.

125
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,930
OK, so we have four pages now.

126
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,600
The first one is done so in second frame.

127
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,680
What I want to do is that I want to an image on the top.

128
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,500
So let's try like this.

129
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:40,510
And I also want to put a brand name on this image, so let's track this endless ad running.

130
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:45,630
So our, you know, will know so this image and this is the brand name.

131
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:49,980
I think the color is the same, so we have to change the color and the branding.

132
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,110
So let's select the master component.

133
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,340
Let's make it more darker like this.

134
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:00,710
And this makes finding page so we are going to regret this action murder.

135
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,400
So next, we want to like username, so let's draw a line.

136
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:09,040
So we need to lines the first one is for username.

137
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,890
And the second one is for.

138
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,850
Password and, uh, uh, we have to earn a log in button.

139
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:26,290
Or more towards the second frame like this, and let's end our log in with buttons.

140
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:29,140
Those are Facebook, Google and we don't.

141
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:34,100
So let's lend them together first, so let's make them bigger.

142
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:38,120
First is going to be Facebook, second is going to be Google.

143
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:46,520
So let's align them together, select Facebook, Hold Shift, Select Log and select Trudeau.

144
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,430
First, we have to add just the bottom.

145
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,600
And lest I them vertically.

146
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:54,580
OK.

147
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:57,430
And let's earn some horizontal spacing.

148
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:58,750
OK.

149
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,430
So these things are aligned.

150
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,470
So in this space, we have a problem.

151
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,110
So our under a will not know.

152
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,460
This is the sign up with your sign in page because all things are the same.

153
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:17,830
So what we can do is that we can make this signing which bold so current it is regular.

154
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,210
Let's make it bold.

155
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,430
OK, now our new will last.

156
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:28,820
This is the sign in page, so next page we have to make.

157
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:30,750
Same thing.

158
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,380
Those are like this brand name.

159
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:39,140
We also have to use these images, so I'm going to copy this, but the things?

160
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,980
We are almost done the the only thing is remaining is that.

161
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,470
Our main page, so on the main page.

162
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:13,060
So he was at is log in now.

163
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,890
So let's make his profile icon.

164
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,600
Let's air the hamburger menu.

165
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,810
This one, I think we have to increase the size of it.

166
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:37,090
Who learned what was the last frame like this?

167
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,940
So let's align them together, hold shift.

168
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,010
Select the profile icon.

169
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,060
Plus bottom and the second is vertical.

170
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:49,600
OK, let's add a text called.

171
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,960
Let's make some categories.

172
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:06,870
So we only have three categories, like what is going on with Visa and told Vanity.

173
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,940
So the list Adam, image for it.

174
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:11,970
Or.

175
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:14,820
Let's make it smaller.

176
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:24,500
And let's allow them to get the whole shift to the second instead of the third one that's at the bottom.

177
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:28,760
And then vertical and let's add some horizontal spacing.

178
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:29,600
OK.

179
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,060
So I just like this, OK?

180
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:37,850
And this are some text and silly categories or.

181
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:44,370
And lest we never turn to both those degrees, different sides.

182
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,080
Hold dragged to the second category.

183
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,040
And let's remember turning to pizza.

184
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,440
And the third one is.

185
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,140
So let's align the fault together.

186
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,130
Now it is a line together, so let's move them.

187
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,510
Legitimate upward, so.

188
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,210
OK.

189
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,000
This is perfect.

190
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:17,920
And so currently we are on like, uh, let's see, currently we are on burger you.

191
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,730
So let's make this image little bit below.

192
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:30,100
So currently in Bogut, currently we are in Burma section, and let's say we have only two options for

193
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,130
the US in the first page.

194
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:39,660
Just make another one like this, and let's make this image bigger because.

195
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:42,750
The user will know.

196
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:48,340
Currently, we selected this bill, and we can also make this text a bold.

197
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:57,260
So our developer will know currently the customer is on the BOGO section and we can earn some prizes.

198
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:02,250
For it, like, oh, let's see, this burger is for.

199
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,780
$15 doesn't give the -- sites.

200
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,150
For the $15.

201
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:17,900
Let's make it up to like twenty four and for second.

202
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:24,370
But let's make it up to like $18.

203
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,040
I know these are quite expensive.

204
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,310
Let's make it normal.

205
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,780
Because the user is selected the first blogger.

206
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,730
And this is the text.

207
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,150
A board like this.

208
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:51,310
Okay, so let's add some sections of it, so our user will know we have more options.

209
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,580
And select the first circular list in the California.

210
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:02,230
So our director will no doubt our customer will.

211
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,930
Currently, he or she is on front page.

212
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,740
So if he swipes, then he's going to be on the second page like this.

213
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,980
I was like, I S. So this is the wireframe for our first project.

214
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,440
That is the light of the project.

215
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:19,230
You can see our final project.

216
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,480
This is our brand name.

217
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,090
You can see brand name plus image.

218
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,590
Log in, sign up.

219
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:32,460
Username, password logging and logging, which button select widow, his book and Google.

220
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,140
Same for here.

221
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:42,550
You can see we also so this logging into like Benkler, because our users will know.

222
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,710
Currently, he is on the logging page and in this page.

223
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:54,580
He will launch his own sign up page, and we can see the categories be the puzzle that you can and you

224
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,130
can see.

225
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,920
We made this burger.

226
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:58,570
Highlighted.

227
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:08,200
So user will noncurrent he's on a category, and first he selected this burger, the first on it and

228
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:19,720
it is $15 burger and you can see I also added the card so he can check out the profile picture and hamburger

229
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:20,020
mean.

230
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,000
And we can also add the surge, but.

231
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,160
So this is the wireframe for our first project.

232
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,600
So in next winter, we are going to make this vital frame into this project.

233
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:41,740
I know this is the very individual, but we just have to drag and drop things and I just do some portion

234
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,940
of the element like this.

235
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,960
So once we make you aware of, you can make your project melt faster.

236
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:54,280
So I'm going to divide every video in the separate part, like in first video, I will add this blessed

237
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:55,140
in analog and faith.

238
00:16:55,150 --> 00:17:04,840
In the first video and the second video, I will add a sign up page and in turn, I will add this main

239
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:10,960
page, which will become more Shorter's, and it will also going to be easy to understand.

240
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,380
So that's what will do, and I will do it next one.
