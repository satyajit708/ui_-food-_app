1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:07,020
Welcome back, In Bruges, where we met this random page, so in this video, we are going to make signing

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:07,440
pitch.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,960
So let's choose a frame.

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,120
iPhone 11 Pro Max.

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,590
OK, like this president admitting to like signing.

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:23,730
So as you can see in wireframe, we place the image, so we are on a blitz image, but in different

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:24,300
format.

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:30,300
So let's make a circle and the shortcut it's all and draw it on the frame like this.

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,020
Let's make it up to like four hundred fifty.

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,250
I think we have to make it beyond that image.

11
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,180
Let's make it up to 70.

12
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:42,730
OK.

13
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,040
OK, let's do the edges so you can see there's a gap.

14
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,940
This move towards the right like this.

15
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:04,140
OK, so the so-called the alert just make it clear to the linea and the first ballot is going to be

16
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,300
our vertical.

17
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,950
And the second pillar is going to be our wet weather like this.

18
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,780
OK, let's close this down.

19
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:24,430
OK, now we have surplus, so let's duplicate this circuit, so the so-called whole world and drag it.

20
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,230
Like this and select the circle.

21
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,410
Go to our tool and choose blessed image.

22
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,760
And let's choose this bizarre image.

23
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,340
Open.

24
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,280
And let's place it on these first ellipse.

25
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,780
So after placing emerge, select the circle this one and let's move on the frame.

26
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:57,050
Like this, let alone it together, OK?

27
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:06,020
And does it in the circle so a lesser degree, the city of two, like 70 to 80 percent less to 70 percent.

28
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,000
OK, this looks good.

29
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,540
And you can see in wireframe, we bless the brand.

30
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,780
So that has led to fertile.

31
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,790
This jagged.

32
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:25,280
Select the brand name holder and mood on the.

33
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,770
So you can frame like this.

34
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:34,250
OK, OK, let's integrate the form sites up to like shipping

35
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,520
and list and just hitting the center.

36
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:43,720
OK.

37
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,420
Like this?

38
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,080
This looks cool.

39
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:49,340
OK, now let's make this sign in navigation more.

40
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,470
So I'm going to use the different method for it.

41
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,360
This a rectangle.

42
00:02:58,980 --> 00:02:59,730
Back this.

43
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,190
I think I have to interpret a little bit.

44
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,570
OK and less island and desanto.

45
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,170
OK, it is in the center now, the upward.

46
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,770
So let's change the ages up to like thirty five.

47
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,120
And now let's change the color of each into white.

48
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:25,080
So let's have some effect like drop shadow.

49
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,270
OK, let's add some settings.

50
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,380
Let's make blood up to 15.

51
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,230
And Spirit up to two.

52
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:38,640
Why?

53
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,500
What's going to be why?

54
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:47,130
OK, now this looks cool, so let's make a log in and sign a button.

55
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,290
So let's choose a rectangle.

56
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:57,760
I added some dimension, you can see the word is 264 and height is fortify and extend what position?

57
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:58,540
You can see here.

58
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,790
So let's make it the sharp corner into round.

59
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:05,800
Let's make it up to 13.

60
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,070
Let's do this shape.

61
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,490
Make it up to help.

62
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:18,780
And listing the color of it, let's make you like, Oh, let's choose this popcorn.

63
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:25,790
And splits it on the top of this, OK, like this?

64
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,130
OK, let's change the color of that worship.

65
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,620
Let's make it white.

66
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,620
Najib Grange.

67
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,150
OK.

68
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:37,760
Like this?

69
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:43,160
OK, let's zoom effect, click on effect so you can see the drop shot is adding.

70
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:48,020
I think it's it's look OK, so I'm going to leave as it is.

71
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,180
So let's make a taste.

72
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,790
The first one is going to be logging.

73
00:04:54,730 --> 00:05:00,610
The currently the font is sensitive one, so let's change it into like five minutes.

74
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,430
And let's make for couple.

75
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,890
Let's add just a phone, according to this tape.

76
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,520
OK, it is in the center now.

77
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:18,530
So let's duplicate this text on, let's make it final.

78
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,930
So we've got to do this totally right, so that's why it is not possible to select the font.

79
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,840
Let's make it black.

80
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,590
Or if you only you can choose this color.

81
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:35,630
He does not look cool unless I learned unless I did it manually.

82
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,090
And dismantle.

83
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:39,440
OK.

84
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:44,990
Like this, I think this is just a bit.

85
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,160
OK, now this looks good.

86
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,560
You find Zoom out.

87
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:55,360
You can see the interface of design and pace, it looks like this.

88
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:00,980
So let's make username password, so go to shapes.

89
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,020
Choose the line.

90
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,670
And let's make it all here.

91
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:15,230
Unless and just less entangle into zero societies in the middle.

92
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:22,860
OK, it is in the middle and let's do a dissembling on Earth.

93
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,010
Drag it down.

94
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:31,100
Let's add some text like email.

95
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:39,560
OK, let's decrease the foreign sites up to like 10 and adjust the text.

96
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,050
Let's change the color of this text.

97
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,970
And also the color line.

98
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,180
Just make it look like this one.

99
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,090
And let's change the color of this line also.

100
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:57,010
Got a stroke, and I think cholesterol cylindrical, and let's make it.

101
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,650
Like this one?

102
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:09,000
Select email and user model donors and listen to the password and also change the color of this line.

103
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:17,250
Now, let's make forward passwords so that this possible text or the old.

104
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:19,750
Closer to you.

105
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:26,520
Scientists like this just make logging button less copy this.

106
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,630
Shape, I think, is going to be fine.

107
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,030
OK, let's change the color of it.

108
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,340
Currently, it is kind of gray.

109
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,080
Let's make it appear like this.

110
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:43,470
And I think this font, which you.

111
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,030
That's all I need to get a.

112
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,130
Well, the thing is, it was in shift.

113
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,370
Bottom horizontal, located in the center, no.

114
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:58,030
So listing that type of font connected is regular.

115
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:01,900
So let's make it semi bald, so it will look more cool.

116
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,700
OK, like this?

117
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,830
OK, what else remaining?

118
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:11,590
So we can see in wherefrom we made everything, so only things are remaining like this.

119
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,090
Log in with buttons.

120
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,780
OK, let's add them from the local files.

121
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,700
OK, let's import those.

122
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:27,230
As to the defiance, OK, let's do the judo for us as group them together.

123
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,780
So why are we are grouping them?

124
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,670
Because these are the HPC players.

125
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:42,600
Let's say I want to go in somewhere so we can see the if I select on this iconic, I see the victory

126
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,110
selector.

127
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,500
So it is going to be a mismatch with our project.

128
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,580
So that's why we are grouping with it.

129
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:53,190
If I selected this whole thing and include them together, it was in control G.

130
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:59,970
So the group now and if I click on this, you can see I can move it wherever I want.

131
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,850
So let's dig into this one.

132
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:15,390
Good idea the height of all the logos of Twitter and Facebook like just to heighten the weight.

133
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,310
And so for Facebook.

134
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,600
And also for good.

135
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:27,850
So we are adjusting weight and height, so it is I just know this because then one of my one.

136
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:41,730
The one thing remaining is that we have to earn attached that is all natural to this statute and hold

137
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:49,950
it and dissenter and let's make it cost less and just seem to center.

138
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:56,290
The figure was a really smart document really going to tell you that at the center of it and also the

139
00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:03,580
spacing in between the tankless increase the font size up to like, well, OK, our signing pages are

140
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,060
ready now.

141
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:06,910
So in next video, we are going to create a sign up page.

142
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,960
So that's it for 2012, and I was in the next one.
