1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,610
Welcome back.

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,460
And previously we met this frame.

3
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,700
Now let's make a UI for our app.

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,310
So what a home.

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,980
Create a new team, let's name it.

6
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,630
You can name it whatever you want.

7
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:19,100
So currently, I'm naming it led to a project one create team.

8
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:22,610
So I'm currently working, so I'm going to skip for now.

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,580
So currently I'm using Freewheelin.

10
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:30,140
That's why I'm going to choose choose starter if we have professional plans that you can choose them.

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:38,180
So just click on starter so you can see our team name and the color of our team.

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,390
Now let's go to wireframe and let's move this.

13
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:42,770
Welcome to our team.

14
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,790
You can see the color of our team and the team project.

15
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,490
OK, our file is not.

16
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,040
Click on Team Project.

17
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:53,470
You can see our wireframe.

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,790
I think we are going to need this sort of drill this one.

19
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:03,480
And click on Team Project and click on Plus button and design for.

20
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:11,000
So we won't be thinking the world frames look different because I accidentally deleted that previous

21
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,730
frame, so that's why I created this bathroom again.

22
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,100
So that's why it looks different.

23
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,890
So let's rename it.

24
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:22,780
Let's choose a frame.

25
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:28,030
Press f choose iPhone 11 Pro Max.

26
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:33,710
So anywhere from you can see the first images for our brand name, so that is lightweight.

27
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,160
So let's create that first frame.

28
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:37,510
This arrangement?

29
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,670
OK, you can name it whatever you want.

30
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,410
So let's choose a text.

31
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,010
OK, let's increase the font size of this text.

32
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,670
To like 64.

33
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,000
OK.

34
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,690
And let's change the font.

35
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:00,860
And too sensitive, a solicitor in the middle.

36
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:11,090
OK, Lisa Lindisfarne was the vertically and then horizontally located alignment and the center.

37
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:15,080
Select the frame and listen to a lot it.

38
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:23,390
Though currently, the color is white, so I'm going to choose the red so currently resolved, so let's

39
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,440
make it gradient.

40
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,420
So a choose linear.

41
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,250
Can the second pillar into poplin?

42
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,650
Or we can choose any color you want.

43
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,950
There's increased opacity of the second pillar.

44
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,180
OK, now it looks cool.

45
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:47,060
So if you want, you can adjust your gradient like this.

46
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:52,820
OK, that looks cool.

47
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:59,180
OK, I think I slept a different font, so save the font.

48
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:03,110
And this is the one we required for this project.

49
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,510
OK.

50
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,700
So that's all I need to together.

51
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,560
Vertically and horizontally at the same time.

52
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,070
OK, Linda, let's make it white.

53
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,040
So it will look more better like this.

54
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:24,580
OK, our first frame is greater now that is brand name page, so you can see in the wireframe.

55
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,870
This is the brand name, and this is the pitch.

56
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,130
So in this world, we are going to create this signing page.

57
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,100
So the secretary and others within the next one.
