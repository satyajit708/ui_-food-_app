1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,570
Welcome back.

2
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,330
Previously, we made to sign up.

3
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:09,240
So in this building, we are going to make this main page so you can see the wire frame for it to choose

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:09,720
a frame.

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,040
iPhone 11 Pro Max your listing image.

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:22,230
OK, let's make this pitch digital with Gray, because we are going to add some elements like search

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,150
bar and also if the search bar is going to be white, so.

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,270
So it is not going to.

9
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,430
So I think there's going to be in the.

10
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,840
And the list in the background and like totally.

11
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:41,550
Like this.

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:49,740
So our mental page will be more visible, so for this mental bridge, you can see in the wire frame,

13
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:56,310
we require this hamburger menu icon, the profile picture icon and text and some images.

14
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,980
So let's make those things.

15
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,520
So in my folder, I have all the resources.

16
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,180
So let's move them into our.

17
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,910
Sigma project.

18
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:10,740
OK.

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,880
The images are like 2B, so we have to consider them.

20
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:25,240
So we have all the resources, like this hamburger menu icon that can handle the profile picture and

21
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,410
some elements like a disposable.

22
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:36,070
So we are going to use one by one for less and just this menu at the top.

23
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:42,580
So less question route and the length and it'll.

24
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:50,560
So the second thing is profile picture, so let's make that profile vigil, OK.

25
00:01:50,990 --> 00:02:01,010
For that, we are going on need ellipse and horseshoe and go to the chapel and place image.

26
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,480
And I going to do this one, you can choose your own image also.

27
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:16,160
And I'm going to put it on this open, OK, I see it is closed, but you can see the photo is kind of

28
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,010
on the right side.

29
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,810
It is infinite and you can see in the fail option, we have this image.

30
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:21,500
Click on it.

31
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,830
And indeed.

32
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,960
And let's choose Grow.

33
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:37,240
And this is the image like this, and OK, the profile picture, it's really.

34
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,400
So this are some stroke, it stroke.

35
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:47,950
Let's make it up to to change the color of this stroke.

36
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,250
The White.

37
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,780
And less recited.

38
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:55,710
You like.

39
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,070
Do you mind?

40
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,850
OK, so let's add some text that is.

41
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,590
Choose the food you love.

42
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,870
So this one will see it in the text.

43
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,760
And controls we.

44
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:17,220
OK.

45
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:22,020
So you can see I used on the.

46
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,500
Falcons want and all.

47
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:33,470
For this upper, I use the regular and the and for this cordial, I used the same word.

48
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,390
So let's add it.

49
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,660
According to this, the icon.

50
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,500
Like this?

51
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:46,380
So what is the next thing we have to do so we can add categories like this?

52
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:51,130
We can do that, but let's earlier search bar.

53
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:54,360
So where users can find these items?

54
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,180
So select the rectangle.

55
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:06,910
We can just copy this ship so that the ship and drag it on the supreme.

56
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:17,660
OK, so let's change the color of it into white, and you can see we already have some drop shadow,

57
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,570
so we can, if you want to, we can adjust it.

58
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,130
I'm going to leave as it is, so let's edit text.

59
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,410
So let's select this text.

60
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:37,010
Austrian imaging to search less and less chance of color of it currently is black.

61
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:42,290
So I'm going to choose according to this search.

62
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,830
Text like this must decrease the size of image.

63
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,230
And this all together.

64
00:04:54,060 --> 00:05:03,140
OK, so it is a now deciding what to let's make the said what a bit bigger, so let's make it great

65
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,490
appeal to hockey.

66
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:16,440
And does it center in the scientist is such and such, I can't.

67
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,230
OK, the next thing is to add categories.

68
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,540
So let's add some categories.

69
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:28,980
OK.

70
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,450
Let's add some categories.

71
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,070
So the rectangle.

72
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,040
And draw it like this.

73
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:41,370
Let's make it up to like worth up to one 10 one one zero.

74
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,280
And the height of the next 70.

75
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:49,360
And let's add some advantages.

76
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,970
Let's make it up to like a quantify.

77
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,420
So looking at this one again or last one?

78
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,740
So let's Linden together.

79
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,350
So let's change the color of which.

80
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,040
Let's make it a white.

81
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,910
If you want, you can also add a drop shadow in you.

82
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,680
Let's change the color of that background.

83
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,630
Currently, the whitest non-visible light my.

84
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:28,850
Are these accounts OK?

85
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,530
These are the you find.

86
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,780
So let's move them together out, control G.

87
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,010
Second one spins out of control key.

88
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,280
Germany, Japan and control.

89
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:46,690
So when we are working with them, so they are not going to mismatch.

90
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:57,060
OK, the first one is one of Ebola, and the and the first section is gender dimension of it, like,

91
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,020
oh, let's queue up to like fifty or forty five.

92
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,940
So let's add to them at the center.

93
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:10,870
OK.

94
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:12,860
They are alone now.

95
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,180
OK, what else is remaining?

96
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:20,540
So we have to name it like woke up is changing the soil a strange image.

97
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,720
So let's name it the first puzzle.

98
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,460
So I'm going to copy this text.

99
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,010
This island in Bermuda.

100
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:36,250
So click on the Pogo Centre, the second and select the pizza, then the bottom.

101
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,000
OK, now I'll end them vertically.

102
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,560
Thanks.

103
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:47,170
So we have to change the color of this burger because currently we are.

104
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,440
The burger section so we can change the color of it.

105
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,530
So users will know is in the burger section.

106
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,830
So let's move this category and this.

107
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,600
S. Little bit moles, of course.

108
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,290
Currently, we are in BOGO section, so we are going to air this.

109
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,040
So let's do the rectangle and draw rectangle like this.

110
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:14,610
Let's give the damage like one certainty and height of like

111
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,100
two one zero.

112
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,960
Let's add some religious side up to let thirty point.

113
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,480
OK.

114
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:34,040
So this one is going to be our first global alert to get this one.

115
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,850
So I'm going to like increase the height of it because currently the user selected this burger.

116
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:44,020
So let's make it up to let's 119 it.

117
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:50,120
Sulking like this, and let's change the color of it, let's make it clear, don't.

118
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:58,990
Let's change the first bill into red and skin color into global.

119
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,880
You can place it wherever you want.

120
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,280
As per requirement.

121
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,710
So I'm going to blessing it all here.

122
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,310
Like this?

123
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,570
OK?

124
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,050
Let's and the image of that burger.

125
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,980
So currently, this is the first burger.

126
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,740
And it's in the color of the white.

127
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,200
This is going to be also Ken Vogel, let's just name them.

128
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:31,560
So the first one, I don't know what is the name of them, but we can name in court you, what do you

129
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:31,860
want?

130
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,550
Or you can search on the Google, the name of the police.

131
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,250
I can call them over here.

132
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,560
So let's change the color of this font.

133
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:41,920
It is black.

134
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,960
Let's make it white.

135
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,480
So it will look more better.

136
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,070
Is the -- sites?

137
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,360
Nothing.

138
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,110
And let's make it simple.

139
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,190
And this and the price of it, Senator, this text holds.

140
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,230
And as our dollar sign.

141
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,240
This is burglaries up to like $18.

142
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,130
Almost the length to text.

143
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,260
Make it up really pretty.

144
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,720
So if you want to, you can also add writings in it.

145
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,460
So let's earn the trading.

146
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,800
I think I having the resources.

147
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:30,390
Let me let me say OK, or I have this dance intro for the project.

148
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,650
OK, you can see the start.

149
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:41,850
And let's change a lot of it into a law like this.

150
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:49,930
So users will know all previous customers had good experience with disposable.

151
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:57,540
Selling them together, so last name this burglar currently distorted words.

152
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,980
So therefore, it is not possible, so let's make it.

153
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,610
Black this.

154
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,720
OK, so unless mortgage or you.

155
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:12,080
And this includes the -- sites of, let's say.

156
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,430
And then just copy this one.

157
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,070
Just change the color of it also.

158
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:28,820
Analysts say the value of it, so it is going to be up to like $15.

159
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,560
OK, what else is remaining?

160
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:41,270
I think the auditing is done, so I think this listing ceremony, so selection of souls and those things

161
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,130
to the ellipse.

162
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,060
Blogs and sermons.

163
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,340
Let's make it like this Gray.

164
00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:02,780
So if the first not and let's it failed or we can choose this.

165
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:03,610
Hello.

166
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,310
On this, make a little bit bigger, so.

167
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,430
User Bill Law is in the food time.

168
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,450
OK, like this.

169
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,460
That's all we have got together.

170
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:30,730
And I think one thing is everything is there to add a card, so let's select the ellipse and show all.

171
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,790
Let's give her a of electric pump.

172
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,310
And all Irish folk.

173
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,800
And this tender inner pillar of grit and into.

174
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:55,360
In asset holder, we have that you can see the back.

175
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,390
So this ad is back shopping bag and the center, so.

176
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,670
And let's change the color of it, but let's make it right.

177
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,660
And do this artistic the center.

178
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,700
OK, thank you.

179
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,470
So everything is done.

180
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,010
So our main obsession is done now.

181
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:24,970
So the only thing is remaining in this project is there to do the right thing.

182
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,180
So in the in the next world, we are going to do protecting.

183
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,090
So that's opportunity.

184
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,160
And I was you guys.

185
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:30,860
