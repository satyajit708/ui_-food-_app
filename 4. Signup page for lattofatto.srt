1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,040
Previously, we managed to sign him first, so in this video, we are going to make a sign of page.

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:10,840
So let's select this frame signing page and two speech.

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,300
Like this and listing image and to sign up.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,530
So you can sign up as we have to change things you can see in the wireframe, the things like we have

5
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:28,500
to change the sign up button, we require some extra lines like on phone password and also we have to

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,400
change the sign up.

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,340
So let's make those changes.

8
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,900
OK, let's first, let's change the color of this font.

9
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,160
Currently, it's kind of low level, so let's make it.

10
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,160
White.

11
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:47,150
And let's move this rectangle.

12
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,440
On the right side.

13
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,960
OK, additional.

14
00:00:54,990 --> 00:01:02,450
So let's turn the color of the logging, so currently, despite the make you this color, OK?

15
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:08,910
OK, now what we have to do is that we have to add one more line and it is going to be our password.

16
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:14,900
So let's move this forward password.

17
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:15,860
That's a good downward.

18
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,780
Like this and this copied this line.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,400
Let's copy this password and this line.

20
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,560
Holder trended downwards.

21
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,100
OK, what password is greater now?

22
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:43,080
OK, let's align them together, select human hold shift, select all the things password dump on password

23
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:48,790
and this last line, and go to a line setting and click on more options and choose.

24
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,770
This should be what you call spacing.

25
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,300
OK.

26
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,350
It is a line now.

27
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,650
I can see you.

28
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,430
So let's move this forward password, little --.

29
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,170
Of course.

30
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,160
OK.

31
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:06,780
Like this.

32
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,440
So currently, we are on a sign up, it's changing to sign up.

33
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:16,030
Let alone it horizontally, we can see it is alone in the center, no.

34
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:27,090
So one thing is determining that some icons like you might seen some apps where you have the eye symbol

35
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:33,480
audio McGillis are those eyes go to S8 like on this dream library.

36
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,370
And toggle this feather icons.

37
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,030
And search for I.

38
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,330
OK, you can see the symbol.

39
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,700
So it was this one.

40
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:52,720
So let's decrease the size of it up to like this, like 60.

41
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,610
So let's change the color of it, currently, it is black.

42
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,910
So we are going to choose this.

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,010
A little simpler of this password.

44
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:12,670
And acidic or drug, you don't sign up bridge and so on.

45
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:13,900
Gone from fast food.

46
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,930
So the only the last thing is remaining, that is the main page.

47
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,630
You can see the wire free market.

48
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,300
So in the next hour, we are going to make that ways.

49
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,920
So that report really good analysis of, hasn't it?

50
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:30,450
Next one.
