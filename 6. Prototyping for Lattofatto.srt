1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:06,960
Welcome back in Brazil, we met this man who paid, so one thing is remaining for this project is there

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,120
to do prototyping so.

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:17,820
So I'll show you how to do prototyping so you can pause the video and do on your own or if you don't

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,520
know how to do it, so you can continue the video.

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,770
So I assume you done that part.

6
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,350
So let's do the programming for this project.

7
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:32,660
Let's go to the panel and you can see this wide shot.

8
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,660
And when I hold over it, it becomes a plus.

9
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:41,870
I can click on it and drag it on the sign in page so you can see this menu will be purple.

10
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,600
So this is don't a detailed panel.

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:53,480
So you can see we have options like aren't so currently listed on tab and navigate to same page.

12
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,720
So we are navigating from Ben Page to signing page.

13
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,240
So it is, it is OK.

14
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,510
So if you want, you can add an image in it.

15
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,610
So currently, let's go with instant.

16
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,770
And I think that's it.

17
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,960
Now click on the same page.

18
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:15,230
So you can see we have options like logging in a sign up, let's say, users and installing this app

19
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:19,580
called First Time, so he want to go to the signup page so he can click on the sign a button.

20
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,560
So let's do it.

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,220
Interaction.

22
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:30,590
So we can see in the interaction, judges are never going to sign up page and the animation is instant.

23
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,530
Let's say it was a race like have already happened and accidentally touch on the sign up button.

24
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:43,010
So here you want to go back on the login page or sign in page so he can go back by using this login

25
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:43,310
button.

26
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:49,580
So let's less what interaction and navigate to and which all these things will be same for it.

27
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,630
So we don't have to change anything.

28
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,190
Audio.

29
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,500
Then let's say it was reported similarly and the password and you want to go to the main menu page.

30
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,410
So let's give the interaction to this button.

31
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,620
OK, from Logan Page, you will go on the main page.

32
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,910
And also the same with design a button.

33
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:19,670
From sign up, he will go on the main page after putting all the details like us username, Emily,

34
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,930
password and password.

35
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,760
I think we're done here.

36
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,370
When I click on the this blank space, we will get these options.

37
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,240
So from here, if you want to change the device, you can change it from here.

38
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,800
So currently I am choosing this iPhone 11 Pro Max, so select this one.

39
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:41,000
And if you want it in the model or you can do it from here, currently it's gold.

40
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:48,060
You can choose silver, space gray green like this and it will show the preview.

41
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,290
And if you want to change the background color of it, you can do it from here.

42
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,000
So currently it is black again, like you would any color you want.

43
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:56,720
Like this?

44
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,980
So let's go with white, so it doesn't matter.

45
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,930
You can choose any color so you can see here we have horizontal and vertical orientation.

46
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:10,220
If you want to change it into horizontal, you continue like this or portrait.

47
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:15,530
So let's go with the portrait and let's click on this present button.

48
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:22,350
You can see our is presenting and the present icon over here on the top.

49
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:22,980
But.

50
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:30,240
OK, you can see the first brand page, if I click on this, we will get on the sign in page.

51
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:35,340
After that, if I click on this blank space, you can see we get two hot kids.

52
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,070
Those are like a sign up and log in page.

53
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:45,180
Let's say I'm a new user and I want to sign up, so I'm going to tap the sign up button and I can put

54
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,000
my details like username, password and confirm password.

55
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,130
And after that, I can sign up.

56
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:58,300
So I can also beg on the log in page if I want like this and let's click on logging.

57
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:03,010
So we're on it so I can order is boggle from you.

58
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,860
If you want to, you can let go animation to these pages.

59
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,050
If we click on this, sign up.

60
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,780
You want to do animation like a moving or mortar push so we can do it from here.

61
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,700
Let's choose a movie and you will see the little interaction over here.

62
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:26,140
And you can also join the time over there, currently with 300 milliseconds and the animation is in

63
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,010
is ithout format.

64
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,880
OK, let's pretend this one.

65
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:36,780
You can press are to restart this application from the beginning.

66
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:42,420
So I'm going to press ah on the keyboard so you can see our landing page.

67
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,390
OK, so let's click on this sign up.

68
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,210
We can see that move in effect audio.

69
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,160
Let me show you one cool thing.

70
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,220
So let's go to Grant Page Random page.

71
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,850
Click on this arrow Typekit arrow.

72
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,190
And currently we are on on tab.

73
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:09,640
So let's go to our smart animation audio and let's live up to like a gender militant and we can change

74
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:15,160
it like argue in direction like aren't about entourage while hovering and all that.

75
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:23,560
Let's just like a while holding onto Mouse Center and let's pretend is less press are to restart.

76
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:29,770
And if I would like a out of my most or this app, you can see that animation.

77
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,220
Let me do it again.

78
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,600
You can see that animation.

79
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:44,060
So let's change a little bit like go order, and let's increase the name up to 500 milliseconds.

80
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,020
And this president yet again to restart.

81
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,650
And on tap, you can see the animation become a bit slow.

82
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:56,320
Like this.

83
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,370
So because of this are smart animation, we get that cool effect.

84
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,350
So I will let go.

85
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,570
Set it over like Boyd Holding.

86
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,770
And let's make it up to victory and putting two hundred looks very cute.

87
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,420
And let's go to within reach.

88
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:17,650
Press of when I like into my mouth on the Ellis brand page, you can see the interaction.

89
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,870
The brand name goes on the top.

90
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:28,180
And if I leave this app, you can see this again comes to the random page and I can do in direction

91
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:28,630
directional here.

92
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,350
Like, sign up.

93
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,870
OK, that you can see that in effect, and you can go to the sign up page if you want to, you can add

94
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,250
animation to dismantle base.

95
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,340
Let's add some animation on the page.

96
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:50,510
Circling the sign up page, follow this arrow, and let's say I had a mission, so let's try this design.

97
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,140
OK.

98
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,830
And let's Britain this one, let's hit our.

99
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:58,630
Log in.

100
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,050
OK, sorry.

101
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,900
He tore sign up page.

102
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:07,820
And from and from sign up basically giving that effect.

103
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,540
OK.

104
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,860
It looks really cool.

105
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:11,580
It is fully.

106
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,320
I think it is very in effect.

107
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,130
Has argued that any mission to the log in button also.

108
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,390
OK, let's hit our.

109
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:30,130
And Long Beach property, that is all different.

110
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:37,330
If you're only going to use a machine like smart animation, so let's choose a smart animation and let's

111
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,700
broaden the screen, hit our.

112
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:48,760
Logging, you can see that cool animation, audio, smart animation that looks cool so you can set any

113
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,780
animation you want.

114
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:52,930
So it depends on you and when you do, that also depends on your project.

115
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:55,420
So this is where we complete our project one.

116
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,490
Let's see if you are struggling with this project.

117
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,790
We have to watch our video again and again to do this project.

118
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,350
So if you made this project, we can share this project on the Instagram or Twitter.

119
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,370
And you can also take me or there.

120
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:14,310
So in the next project, we are going to make a movie website or you can say, like a streaming service

121
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,500
application like Netflix, Amazon Prime.

122
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,330
So that's me signing off.

123
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,700
Thanks for watching, and I was already in the next one.
